    A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions
    automatically.[2] Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots
    may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no
    regard to their aesthetics.
    Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative
    Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots,
    patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics
    MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot
    may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the
    coming decade,[3] with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.[4]
